# ast-match

A library to facilitate easier manipulation of Python AST (abstract syntax tree) objects.

This library allows you to write the syntax in an intuitive way, instead of having to write the names of the internal classes in `ast` module.

For manipulating the internal structure, it's recommended to read through https://docs.python.org/3/library/ast.html to know what kind of nodes may appear in an AST.
